    "## Models Considered  \n",
    "### ViT  \n",
    "#### Background  \n",
    "- **Vision Transformer (ViT)** divides an image into fixed-size patches, flattens them, and processes them with transformer encoder blocks—borrowing the global **self-attention** mechanism from NLP.  \n",
    "- **Why ViT?**  \n",
    "  - Often achieves **state-of-the-art** on vision tasks with fewer inductive biases than CNNs—useful when distinguishing subtle “AI-generated” artifacts.  \n",
    "  - Its patch-based attention can capture long-range dependencies (e.g., unnatural textures spanning the image).  \n",
    "- **Freezing and Unfreezing**  \n",
    "  - We **freeze** early transformer blocks and the patch embedding to preserve the powerful pretrained ImageNet representations and reduce trainable parameters.  \n",
    "  - After a few epochs, we **unfreeze** the last block for **fine-tuning**—allowing the model to adapt high-level features to our two-class problem without catastrophic forgetting.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### EfficientNet-B3  \n",
    "#### Background  \n",
    "- **EfficientNet-B3** is a CNN optimized via **compound scaling** (uniformly increasing depth, width, and resolution) for efficiency and performance.  \n",
    "- **Why EfficientNet?**  \n",
    "  - Balances computational cost and accuracy, often outperforming larger models like ResNet50 with fewer parameters.  \n",
    "  - Its **depthwise separable convolutions** reduce redundancy, making it efficient for detecting subtle artifacts in AI-generated images.  \n",
    "- **Freezing and Unfreezing**  \n",
    "  - We **freeze** early blocks (stem and intermediate layers) to retain generic feature extractors (e.g., edge detectors).  \n",
    "  - Gradually **unfreeze** later blocks (e.g., `blocks_6` to `blocks_8`) to fine-tune task-specific hierarchical features while avoiding overfitting.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### ResNet50  \n",
    "#### Background  \n",
    "- **ResNet50** is a classic residual network with **skip connections**, enabling stable training of very deep architectures by mitigating vanishing gradients.  \n",
    "- **Why ResNet50?**  \n",
    "  - Provides a **reliable baseline**—its performance is well-documented across domains, making comparisons interpretable.  \n",
    "  - Residual blocks excel at preserving gradient flow, which is critical for learning fine-grained artifacts in AI-generated images.  \n",
    "- **Freezing and Unfreezing**  \n",
    "  - We **freeze** all layers except the final residual block (`layer4`) and the fully connected head.  \n",
    "  - This ensures the model retains low-level features (e.g., textures) while adapting high-level representations to the binary classification task.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### ConvNeXt  \n",
    "#### Background  \n",
    "- **ConvNeXt** modernizes CNNs by adopting transformer-inspired designs (e.g., **large kernel sizes**, LayerNorm, and fewer activation layers).  \n",
    "- **Why ConvNeXt?**  \n",
    "  - Bridges the gap between CNNs and transformers, offering ViT-like performance with CNN efficiency.  \n",
    "  - Its **hierarchical feature maps** (like traditional CNNs) may better capture local artifacts (e.g., unnatural pixel clusters) in AI-generated images.  \n",
    "- **Freezing and Unfreezing**  \n",
    "  - We **freeze** early stages (`stem` and `downsampling layers`) to leverage pretrained hierarchical representations.  \n",
    "  - **Unfreeze** later stages (e.g., `stage 3` and `stage 4`) to refine global context understanding for the task.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Loading Pretrained & Freezing  \n",
    "- **Pretrained weights** give you a huge head start—your dataset is relatively small, so training from scratch would overfit or converge slowly.  \n",
    "- **Freezing** early layers:  \n",
    "  - Reduces total trainable parameters → speeds up training  \n",
    "  - Protects general, low-level features (edges, textures) from being wiped out by random gradients on a small dataset  \n",
    "- **Gradual unfreezing**:  \n",
    "  - Allows high-level blocks to adapt to the new task while retaining stable low-level feature detectors  \n",
    "  - Done at a lower learning rate (via scheduler) to avoid large parameter jumps  \n"

    "- Build the chosen model (e.g. ViT), move it to `device`, and set up:\n",
    "  - **loss_fn** = CrossEntropyLoss (standard for multi‑class/binary tasks)  \n",
    "  - **optimizer** = Adam on only `requires_grad=True` parameters (faster convergence)  \n",

    "### Insight\n",
    "- Starting with a **low LR (1e‑4)** helps fine‑tuning avoid large parameter shifts.  \n",
    "- A **few epochs** (e.g., 5) plus early stopping is usually enough when fine‑tuning a pretrained model.\n",

    "\n",
    "- **Precision** = TP / (TP + FP)  \n",
    "  - Measures how reliable the model is when it predicts an image as \"AI-generated.\"  \n",

    "\n",
    "- **Recall (Sensitivity)** = TP / (TP + FN)  \n",
    "  - Measures how well the model captures AI-generated images without missing them.  \n",
    "  - Example: If there are 100 true AI-generated images, and the model detects 70, the recall is 70%.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **F1-score** = 2·(Precision·Recall) / (Precision + Recall)  \n",
    "  - A balanced metric combining precision and recall, useful when class imbalance exists.  \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why F1 for this competition?  \n",
    "- **Class imbalance** occurs when one category (e.g., \"AI-generated images\") is significantly rarer than another (e.g., \"human-generated images\"). For example:  \n",
    "  - If only 10% of the dataset is AI-generated and 90% is human, a naive model that *always* predicts \"human\" would achieve 90% accuracy—while failing entirely on the AI class.  \n",
    "  - Metrics like accuracy become misleading because they favor the majority class.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **F1-score mitigates this issue** by:  \n",
    "  - Ignoring true negatives (TN) in its calculation, focusing instead on the model’s ability to:  \n",
    "    1. Correctly identify the rare class (AI images, via **recall**).  \n",
    "    2. Avoid mislabeling human images as AI (via **precision**).  \n",
    "  - Penalizing models that over-predict the majority class (e.g., always guessing \"human\").  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Example**:  \n",
    "  - In a dataset with 95% human images, a model with 95% accuracy could be useless if it never detects AI images.  \n",
    "  - F1-score would expose this failure by dropping to ~0% if recall (AI detection) is 0%.  \n",
